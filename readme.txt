Please note: I recommend that you hand enter code rather than downloading it. 
That way you will learn more, and have more fun, too!

INSTRUCTIONS:

The source code is organized in HTML files by chapter, so the first two digits in each file name
designate the chapter the source file is associated with. For example, 0301.html is the first 
program in Chapter 3 of "Learn How to Program." (Note that the sequential numbering of source 
files within each chapter does not correspond to the listing numbers in the book, because some 
programs are represented by more than one book code listing.)


To run the programs, first download the zip archive to your computer. Next, unzip the file to 
the folder of your choice. (Presumambly you've already successfully performed these steps as 
you are reading this!) Finally, open each HTML file in your Web browser (for detailed instructions 
about how to do this, see "Writing and Running Your First Program" in 
Chapter 1 of "Learn How to Program").


You can view the source code of any HTML file that is open in a Web browser. To do this in 
Internet Explorer, choose Source from the View menu. In Mozilla or Netscape, choose 
Page Source from the View menu. 


Finally, you should note that this zip archive contains a few miscellaneous files used in 
Chapter 11 in addition to source code files. These are the .Gif files used in the rollover 
example, and "LearnToProgram.html," which is the "password protected lite" example 
file used in that chapter.


Thanks for reading my book.


I am always interested in hearing about problems with the source code, or suggestions for 
improvements or extensions to any of the examples.
